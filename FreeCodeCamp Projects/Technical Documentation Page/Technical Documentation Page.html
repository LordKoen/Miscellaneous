                    Guide to computer components
                </h1>
                <p>
                    In this documentation page I will talking about the role and importance of the main compenents used when building a computer, 
                    the components are:
                    <ul style="text-transform: capitalize; font-weight: bold;">
                        <li>The CPU</li>
                        <li>The motherboard</li>
                        <li>the RAM</li>
                        <li>the storage</li>
                        <li>The graphics card</li>
                        <li>the case</li>
                        <li>the power supply</li>
                    </ul>
                    Hopefully this guide will help you understand what each specific component does and how it is important for the system as a whole,
                    which will allow to make a more informed decision when choosing how to spread your budget across the computer componenents.

                <h2>
                    CPU
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Central Processing Unit, or CPU is essentially the brain of the computer. It is one of the most important parts of the computer, carrying out all
                    the calculations, and telling all the other components what they are supposed to do after receveing their intructions by the software. Because of this the 
                    CPU is an expensive part of the computer and one of the three parts of a computer in which spending more money means a significantly and noticeable
                    performance gain. <br>
                    There are 3 main things to note when looking at a CPU and how fast/powerful it will be:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Number of Cores</li>
                        <li>Clock Speeds</li>
                        <li>Architecture</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Number of Cores
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A CPU chip can a have different number of central Processing units, although at the beginning most CPU's only had a single core this could not be 
                    further from the truth today with consumer grade CPU having up to 16 cores (Thanks to AMD with their Ryzen 9 3950x) and workstation/server CPUs having
                    up to 64 cores! <br>
                    The number of cores essentially affects how many different things a CPU can do simultaneously, if a CPU has more cores it will be able to do 
                    multiple things at once a lot better than if it had less cores. And if an application is able to take advantage and use more cores these applications
                    will also be faster as they will physically have more cores working on it at once. Examples of applications like these include image processing or 
                    rendering of animation. <br>
                    However the number of cores is not the only thing that affects how powerful a CPU is, some activites and applications do not requires multiple cores
                    but a single one, which is where the next property of the CPU comes in. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Clock Speeds
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This is the speed of the CPU, it is measured in gigahertz (GHz) and it is quite literally how fast the CPU is, with a CPU that can achieve higher 
                    clock speeds being able to process and do more calculations in a given amount of time when compared to a slower one. Some of the fastests CPUs 
                    are able to hit clock speeds of 5.0 Ghz! <br>
                    This means that application that do not need a lot of cores such as gaming or 3D graphics work will directly benefit from a higher clock speed as it will
                    be able to do physically more as the calculations are happening faster, and all things kept the same a higher CPU that has a higher clock speed than another
                    will be faster and better. <br>
                    However, now we are going to cover the most important factor that determines how fast and powerful a CPU is.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Architecture
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Architecture of a CPU refers to its basic design and complexity and as mentioned earlier is the most important factor when it comes to determining 
                    how powerful a CPU is. Some CPUs are esssentialy more complex and sophisticated than other and a CPU that has a newer and more efficient Architecture 
                    will normally be a lot better than an old one, sometimes even if the old one has more cores or a higher clock speeds. <br>

                <h2>
                    Motherboard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Motherboards, often referred to as a logic board, main board or “mobo” for short, are the “back-bone” of the computer. 
                    Its purpose is to connect all the parts of the computer together and make everything centralized using its printed circuit board. 
                    The central processing unit, hard drives, memory, graphic processing unit, printers, and other ports all 
                    connect to the computer directly or via special cables that attach on to the motherboard. <br>
                    it was important to purchase sound cards but today they tend to be 
                    integrated into the motherboard already so you are actually saving money thanks to technological advances! If you are tight on a budget it is recommended
                    that you do not cheap out on the motherboard since all your computer parts will run according to the specifications of the slots available on the 
                    motherboard. You want to spend your big bucks here to guarantee you receive a system circuit or nervous system that can perform for a prolonged period 
                    like the human body. <br>
                    Different motherboards fit different CPUs so normally the motherboard should be decided after thinking about the CPU itself.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Motherboard sizes
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Motherboards come in three main sizes (From biggest to smallest):
                    <ul>
                        <li>ATX</li>
                        <li>Micro-ATX</li>
                        <li>Mini-ITX</li>
                    </ul>
                    The three different sizes affect how number of slots that a motherboard has, with an ATX motherboard normally having 4 slots from ram and a few PCIE-express ports
                    whilte an Mini-ITX normally only having 2 RAM slots and single PCIE-express slot, however with the advantage of a much smaller footprint. <br>
                    ATX motherboards offers the possiblity of expansions and has the capabilites of having a lot more slots which makes it perfect for a powerful workstation, while
                    a Mini-ITX can have great perfomance at a small size which makes it perfect for home theater setups. <br>
                    The sweet spot is definitely Micro-ATX offering the best compromise of size, value, perfomance and upgradability.

                <h2>
                    RAM
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RAM -- or "random access memory" -- is the temporary storage space that a computer loads software applications and user data into when it is running. 
                    All current RAM technologies are "volatile", which means that everything held in RAM is lost when a computer's power is removed. To a large extent, 
                    the more RAM a computer has the faster and more effectively it will operate. Computers with little RAM have to keep moving data to and from their hard
                    disks in order to keep running. This tends to make them not just slow in general, but more annoyingly intermittently sluggish. <br>
                    Depending on how old the operating system is and what kind the use case of the computer different amounts of RAM are necessary, for examples older systems 
                    such as Windows XP are happy with 1GB and Windows 7 with about 4GB, however more recent OS need a lot more RAM with the sweet spot being between 8 and 16GB for most people,
                    however very heavy workloads could benefit from 32 to 128GB.

                    There are 2 main technologies of non-volatile storage: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hard Drives</li>
                        <li>SSDs</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Hard Drives
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Spinning hard disk (HD) drives are today the most common means of high capacity computer storage, with most desktop and laptop computers still relying on a spinning hard 
                    disk to store their operating system, applications programs and at least some user data. Traditional, spinning hard di sk drives consist of one or more disk "platters" 
                    stacked one above the other, and coated in a magnetic media that is written to and read by the drive heads <br>
                    Hard disks are almost always manufactured with either 3.5" of 2.5" platters (although just to break the rule a few smaller -- most notably 1.8" -- and even some larger 
                    platter disks are made by some manufacturers). 
                    For many years 3.5" hard disks have been standard for desktop computers and servers, and 2.5" hard disks for laptops

                <h3>
                    SDDs
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I recommend getting a 240GB SSD or greater. If that’s too much for your budget, 
                    you can opt for a 120GB SSD for at least the operating system. Having an SSD for your OS will allow you to boot up your PC super fast.
                    The new hotness in super-fast storage is Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) drives. They come in two form factors. Intel’s 750 PCIe SSD requires a PCIe slot, 
                    whereas Samsung’s 960 Pro requires an M.2 slot. While these drives are insanely fast, you will be paying a premium for them. For reference, Samsung’s 960 Evo
                     NVMe SSD is up to five times as fast as traditional 2.5-inch SATA-based SSDs, but cost about twice as much.

                <h2>
                    Graphic Cards
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now it is time to look at how your computer puts out such beautiful visuals. This is no miracle. 
                    The Graphics processing unit (GPU) often referred to as a graphics card is used primarily for 3D applications. 
                    NVIDIA, a global corporation that manufactures graphics processors, mobile technologies, and desktop computers defines a GPU as a 
                    “single chip process that aids in creating lighting effects and transforming objects every time a 3D scene is redrawn” (Britannica). 
                    This is the equivalent to how your eyes function and relate your beautiful visual sensory details to your brain. These calculations 
                    are extremely mathematically intensive tasks that would put fair amount of strain on the CPU. By allowing the GPU to take over these tasks 
                    it enable the CPU to tend to other non-visual related calculations that the computer needs to function. GPU’s are interesting since they are 
                    manufactured by either NVIDIA or Radeon and can range from $40-$1000 or more. The GPU do not have a limit and are always being tested to find
                    the next generation of technology that can duplicate the visuals we see as humans.

            <section id="case" class="main-section">
                <h2>
                    Case
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Arguably the most important thing to look for in a case is its size. It roughly follows the same size guidelines as motherboards.
                    Meaning, Mini-ITX chassis are for Mini-ITX boards, Micro-Towers are good for Micro-ATX boards, Mid-Towers pair well with ATX boards, 
                    and full-towers are designed for Extended-ATX mobos. Another thing to look out for is, well, looks. Yes, you can get a cheap case if 
                    you’re on a budget, and it will do the job, but the case is the shell of your hot rod. Thankfully, you don’t need to spend a ton to get a nice looking case. Take
                    for instance the Fractal Designs R5 pictured here. At around $110, the mid-tower offers a sexy, yet minimalist design that isn't outlandishly expensive.
                    <br>
                    Aside from the aesthetics, you’ll want to make sure the case can fit all of your components. We’re not just talking about the motherboard here.
                    If you’re going to be getting a bulky aftermarket cooler, a giant video card, or a large power supply, for instance, you’ll want to make sure those 
                    parts will fit in that case. The case will often give you height or GPU-length info, but in case it gets too confusing, using a website like PCPartPicker, 
                    which informs you of incompatibility issues, can help you solve the problem.
                    <br>
                    Other things to look for in your case is to ask yourself: Does it have any cable management options to keep the innards of your PC tidy? 
                    Does it include any fans? Does it offer good airflow with vents at the top and back/sides? Does it include dust filters?

                    Humans eat food to acquire important nutrients to maintain health and provide energy for the body. This energy is what enables us to do work and complete tasks. 
                    In the same way that we eat to acquire this energy a computer utilizes a power supply unit (PSU), which is in charge of bringing electrical power to the computer. 
                    The PSU helps convert AC (alternating currents) from your home to the DC (direct current) needed to power your computer components. You want to make sure you don’t
                     cheap out on this because it supplies power to all the parts and peripherals (USB, external hard drives, hubs, mouse, keyboard, etc.) you enjoy when you use your 
                     computer. By purchasing a reliable PSU, you are ensuring that all your components are capable of working to max capacity at all times and also provides that extra 
                     boost of energy to help you get through your school work, intense gaming, or designing. Athletes eat to maintain their body’s health and energy in the same way that 
                     computer builders pick PSU that are durable and reliable to maximize component potential.
