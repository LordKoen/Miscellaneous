            Selecting by ID
        </h2>
        <p>
            An item can be selected by ID, to do this go to the item and after it write [id="tagname"]. Then to make changes go into the style tag and write [#tagname] and insert the CSS commands inside. <br>
            The problem with this method is that ids have to be different therefore you could not select and whole group of items. <br>
            <strong> This can also be attributed to tags such as strong and em. </strong>
        </p>
        <h2 class="classname">
            Selecting by Class
        </h2>
        <p class="classname">
            Selecting by class is similar to selecting by ID, however they are used when a whole number of items in the same group want to be selected <br>
            To use it go for the item and write [class="classname"], and to use it go to the style tag and write [.classname] <br>
            The main advantage of this is that the same class can be used for multiple items, sort of grouping them together

            <li>tbody: This is for the body of the table, the values that go underneath the heading and a td is needed for each value</li>
